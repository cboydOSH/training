            <p>You are enrolling in a Health Care Sharing Ministry administered by OneShare Health, LLC (OneShare). A Health Care Sharing Ministry is not health insurance, and it does not guarantee or promise that your medical bills will be paid. A Health Care Sharing Ministry is a group of individuals who share a common set of ethical or religious beliefs and share medical expenses in accordance with those beliefs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The members of this Health Care Sharing Ministry voluntarily share medical expenses with one another, and OneShare coordinates this medical sharing. OneShare programs should not be considered as a substitute for an insurance policy. You are always liable for your own unpaid medical bills. </p>
            <br>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">OneShare Health Disclaimer</p>

            <br>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">No Promise to Pay</p>
            <p>Neither OneShare nor its members promise or guarantee payment or sharing of your medical expenses, or assume any risk therefore. You remain responsible for your unpaid medical bills.</p>
            <br>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Voluntary Participation</p>
            <p>Enrollment in OneShare is not a contract for insurance. Participation in OneShare is voluntary.

            <br>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Guidelines</p>
            <p>OneShare manages member sharing contributions by establishing guidelines that define which medical bills are eligible for sharing (“Guidelines”). Neither the Guidelines, nor anything else presented by OneShare, constitutes a contract for insurance. The Guidelines do not constitute a legally binding agreement, a promise to pay, or an obligation to share. The Guidelines specify what type of expenses are eligible for sharing requests. OneShare reserves the right to exclude sharing eligibility for any pre- existing conditions, whether disclosed at the time of your enrollment or discovered after the effective date of the membership. OneShare reserves the right to update and change its Guidelines at any time, and will provide notice of any material updates/changes. It is the Member’s responsibility to review the current guidelines in their Member portal.</p>
            <br>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Administration</p>
            <p>Upon receiving an eligible medical need from a Member or Provider, OneShare Health will assign the medical need for sharing in accordance with the Guidelines, less the amount required to be pre-shared (Individual Sharing Amount). Voluntary Membership contributions are received from each Member monthly. Up to 40% of Membership contributions may be applied towards administration of the Health Care Sharing Ministry, charitable causes, and general overhead costs. This does not include third party contracts and distribution compensation. In any given month, the available sharing funds may or may not equal the amount of eligible expenses submitted for sharing. If eligible expenses exceed the available sharing funds to meet those needs, any of the following actions may be taken:</p>
              <br>
                <ol class=nds-list_ordered>
                    <li> A pro-rata sharing of eligible expenses may be initiated, whereby the Members share a percentage of eligible medical expenses within that month and hold back the balance of those expenses to be shared the following month, or </li>
                    <li> The monthly member contribution may be increased in sufficient proportion to satisfy the eligible expenses. This action may be undertaken temporarily or on an ongoing basis Administrative costs are subject to change by OneShare Health.</li>
