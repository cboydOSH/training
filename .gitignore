#if you are not customizing a managed package, you can keep your repository clean by ignoring 
#all files for that package. For example, to ignore all files of the "Copado" managed package
#just add to your gitignore file the following text: *copado__*
#if you will be customizing managed packages, make sure that the same version of the package 
#is installed on all your environments so that deployments will only update existing 
#managed components. Creation of managed components is not permitted by the API.
#It is recommended that you ignore
