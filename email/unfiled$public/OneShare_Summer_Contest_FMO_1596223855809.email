  <br /> Dear {{{Recipient.FirstName}}}, 
  <br /> &nbsp; 
  <br /> 
  <br /> August is upon us and if it’s not hot enough already, OneShare Health wants to turn up the heat s’more! OneShare Health will be hosting a Summer Sizzler, and YOU could win! The time has never been better to spread the word about our medical cost-sharing programs, which are available 365 days a year. Let’s get a head start before Open Enrollment and make August your most successful month yet! &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  <br /> &nbsp; 
  <br /> If selected, the Top FMO could win $1,000! All you need is a minimum of 100 applications to qualify. We’re also awarding $500 to the Top Producer, with a minimum of 20 applications to qualify. This is an excellent opportunity to present an affordable option to your customers while increasing your earning potential!&nbsp; 
  <br /> 
  <br /> This challenge will run from August 1st to 31st, so bring out that competitive side and let’s get ready to have some fun while making a difference together!&nbsp; 
  <br /> 
  <br /> 
  <br /> Best of luck and thank you for all you do!
